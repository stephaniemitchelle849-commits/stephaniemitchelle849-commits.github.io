<p> ABOUT ME: </p> 
<p> I am a Mexican-American Graphic Designer and illustrator that is based in Connecticut.

<p>  My career focus on graphic design work with some illustration interest. 
My body of works tend to focus on my Mexican heritage along with curiosity of creating design work in different areas like: 
packaging, book making, typography, make illustrations for my personal work and for client work, multi media work. </p>

Along with a passion for a dream of mine to be able to be part of the prestigious agencies in New York I love to be able to communication design and 
make unique identities of brands, of new body of work. I capture a interest also for love for printmaking that can twist a nice hand to hand with graphic design. I really like to make things and be able to feel the experiences while doing them and transform them in the final product. </p>

<p> I love to be able to make work for my community and for other type of subjects I am intrigued to tell about in express my art too. I am so excited to see what future artworks I've come to create and the opportunities that life bring me in order to become the designer I choose to be </p>
